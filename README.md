# Magento Blank Widget

## Overview

This is a bare bones, blank extension that will create a widget instance for Magento 1.X. It has 4 basic content areas:
* An image upload
* A text field
* A textarea field
* A dropdown menu with multiple select options

You will need to add the [image uploader extension](https://github.com/aijko/aijko-widgetimagechooser) as this extension depends on it.

## Installation

Just drag the files/folders to the correct locations in your Magento installation, and clear your cache. You may opt to add the `widgets` folder either to your custom theme or `base/default`, either will work. Once the extension is installed you can access it either via `CMS > Widgets > Create New Widget Instance` or `CMS > Static Blocks > Insert widget in a block` or `CMS > Pages > Insert widget on a page`.

## Compatibility
Tested on Magneto EE 1.14.2.4 & CE 1.9.2.4
